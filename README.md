# TextParser 

## Coding Challange
As a coding challange, I was tasked with parsing 3 files containing properties of a person each delimited by a different character. I then needed to combined that data into one table and finally print it to the console sorted by different columns. 

## Solution
As a solution to this problem I created a module called ***TextParserMatrix***. This module facilitates parsing, sorting, printing, and maintaining separate strings of delimited text as one table. This abstaction made solving the coding challange much easier. Also this abstaction is something I can see myself adding to and using again in the future.

3. Run `npm start` from the command line to see the code test results printed in the console window.
