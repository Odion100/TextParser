# TextParser 

## Coding Challange
As a coding challange, I was tasked with parsing 3 files containing properties of a person each delimited by a different character. The next requirement was to then combined the data into one table and finally to sort and print that data as 3 different outputs. 

## Solution
As a solution to this problem I created a module called ***TextParserMatrix***. This module facilitates parsing, sorting, and printing separate files of delimited text as one table. This abstaction made solving the coding challange a lot easier. Also this abstaction is something I can see myself adding to and using again in the future. 

## Build

1. Ensure that you have NodeJS installed on your OS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Download the repo and run `npm install` from the command line. 
3. Run `npm start` from the command line to see the code test results printed in the console window.

## Test
1. Install mocha globally - `npm install mocha -g`
2. Run `npm test` from the command line
